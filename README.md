Welcome to my GitHub repository for all of my assignments from Kristianstad HÃ¶gskola!

This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of the coursework I completed during my time at Kristianstad University. Each course has its own dedicated folder, and within each course folder, you will find separate folders for each assignment.

The main purpose of sharing my assignments on this platform is to showcase my learning journey, demonstrate my problem-solving skills, and provide a glimpse into the projects I have worked on throughout my academic career. By organizing everything in one place, it becomes easier for others to navigate and explore my coursework effortlessly.

Feel free to browse through the repository, explore the various folders, and dive into the assignments that pique your interest. I have included relevant documentation, source code, and any additional resources that might be helpful in understanding the context and objectives of each assignment.
